# Ecommerce Domain Checker

## Overview

This Python script identifies potential ecommerce websites from a list of domains by checking for visible shopping carts and other indicators. It leverages the requests library for fetching website content and Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML.

## Installation

Clone this repository.
Install required libraries:
Bash
```pip install requests beautifulsoup4```
## Usage

Save the domains to a file named domains.txt, with each domain on a separate line.
Run the script:
Bash
```python script_name.py```
## Configuration

Class Name: Adjust the ```class_ attribute in soup.find_all("div", class_="shopping-cart")``` to match the specific class used for shopping cart elements on the websites you're checking.
Timeout: Modify the timeout value in ```requests.get(url, timeout=10)``` to adjust how long the script waits for website responses.
## Considerations

Accuracy: The script's accuracy depends on the consistency of shopping cart element classes and website structures. Consider adding more checks for product listings, checkout buttons, or payment gateways to improve accuracy.
Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling for website access issues. It's recommended to implement more robust error handling to ensure uninterrupted execution.
Testing: Thoroughly test the script with a sample of domains before large-scale deployment.
